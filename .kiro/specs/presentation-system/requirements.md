# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for creating two comprehensive presentation documents for the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) tutorial project. The deliverables are: (1) a detailed slide content specification document and (2) a complete presentation script with speaker notes for a 10-minute technical presentation showcasing the PINN tutorial system's achievements with real KGS well data.

## Glossary

- **Slide Content Specification**: A markdown document containing exact slide content, visual placement, and formatting instructions
- **Presentation Script**: A markdown document containing complete speaker notes, timing, and delivery guidance
- **KGS Data**: Kansas Geological Survey well log data used in the PINN system
- **PINN**: Physics-Informed Neural Networks
- **Visual Placement Guide**: Instructions for where visual elements should be positioned on slides
- **Speaker Notes**: Detailed script with timing and emphasis guidance for presentation delivery

## Requirements

2. WHEN writing speaker content, THE Document SHALL include smooth transition phrases between slides
3. WHEN specifying delivery guidance, THE Document SHALL mark key statistics and technical points for emphasis
4. WHERE complex concepts are presented, THE Document SHALL include simplified explanations and analogies
5. WHILE structuring the script, THE Document SHALL ensure total presentation time equals exactly 10 minutes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technical presenter, I want accurate references to visual assets, so that I can include the correct diagrams and charts in my slides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN referencing visual content, THE Slide Specification SHALL identify existing architecture diagrams by file path
2. WHEN specifying performance data, THE Slide Specification SHALL include accurate statistics from project results
3. WHEN describing visual layouts, THE Slide Specification SHALL provide clear positioning instructions
4. WHERE charts or tables are needed, THE Slide Specification SHALL define exact data and formatting requirements
5. WHILE organizing visual elements, THE Slide Specification SHALL ensure consistency in style and presentation
